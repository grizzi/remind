Set secrets on remind-backend: SECRET_KEY

Your database remind-backend-redis is ready. Apps in the personal org can connect to Redis at redis://default:e1e2ec3b10a044f898524f5ad879141e@fly-remind-backend-redis.upstash.io:6379

If you have redis-cli installed, use fly redis connect to get a Redis console.

Your database is billed at $0.20 per 100K commands. If you're using Sidekiq or BullMQ, which poll Redis frequently, consider switching to a fixed-price plan. See https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/#pricing
